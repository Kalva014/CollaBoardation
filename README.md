* This project will be a combination of the microsoft whiteboard app and google docs where people can set up multiple whiteboards and all draw on it in real-time.
* Inspiration: Microsoft Whiteboard

## Importance and Interests:
* It seems practical where people would actually use it to display ideas and such
* We will learn about how servers work cause multiple people will be working on the same whiteboard
* We can print the whiteboard so people can save their ideas
* Add a chat bar which allows for team communication
